== About jquery-ui-forms

A Full-Featured HTML5 Forms Polyfill that leverages jQuery UI Widgets and Framework Validation

image::https://travis-ci.org/bsatrom/jquery-ui-forms.png[Build Status, link="https://travis-ci.org/bsatrom/jquery-ui-forms"]

== Compatibility and Requirements

jquery-ui-forms was designed to work with jQuery UI. The project currently depends on the following libraries:

- http://www.jquery.com[jQuery] v1.10+
- http://www.jqueryui.com[jQuery UI] vCurrent

kendo-ui-forms has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may find that versions other than these are compatible with kendo-ui-forms, but we make no claims to support those version, nor can we troubleshoot issues that arise when using those versions.

== Source Code

This repository contains both the full and minified builds of the library in the +dist+ folder

A working sample of the plugin can be found in the +samples+ directory

== Downloading and Installing

Once you clone the repo, run

[source]
----
npm install
----

to grab all of the essential dependencies for dev, build and test. The repo uses grunt for all of these, so run

[source]
----
grunt
----

to make sure everything is working. If you see text indicating that the jshint, concat and uglify tasks have run without errors, you're golden!

== Running the Tests

Tests are written in http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/[jasmine] and can be found in the spec/ directory. To run the tests from the command-line, call

[source]
----
grunt test
----

The Kendo UI Forms Project also uses http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html[Karma] to ensure cross-browser coverage of all tests. Browsers tested include:

- Google Chrome
- Google Chrome Canary
- Firefox
- Opera
- Safari [OSX Only]
- IE [Windows Only]

If you don't have any of these browsers, Karma will fail. But hey, this is cross-browser polyfill development here, so just install them all!

To run Karma, you can call

[source]
----
grunt x-test
----

and Karma will take care of launching each browser, running the specs and shutting them down again (except for Safari, for some reason, so that's awesome).

If you want to run the jasmine tests in your browser, as opposed to running the multi-browser tests or from the console every time, you can spin up a local webserver and navigate to spec/runner.html, or navigate directly via the filesystem

----

.*Running Karma in Chrome*
[NOTE]
____
If you're using Chrome and taking the latter approach, some of the tests will fail because of cross-domain features in Chrome. To work around this, run Chrome with the +--allow-file-access-from-files+ terminal command. 

For OSX:

[source]
----
open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
----

And Windows:

[source]
----
C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome[ SxS]\Application\chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files
----
